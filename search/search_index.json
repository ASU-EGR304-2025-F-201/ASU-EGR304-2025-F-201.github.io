You can find out more about our team in the \"Team Organization\" section of this website.   Our team was tasked with developing a product that can improve and streamline our customers' day-to-day lives. As a team, we decided to make a device that would help our users with their gardening needs. We want to help anyone, from house plant owners to small-scale farmers, streamline the care of their plants through a useful sensing device. The constraints for this project are for each of us to develop either a sensing or actuating subsystem for the device that would help meet the user needs and product requirements of our customers. Once we have designed these subsystems, after considering all of the feedback we receive, we are going to create prototype PCBs to verify the functionality of our device. We will consider this project a success if we create a system of four collaborative boards that all function together to achieve our project's defined goals.</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"#team-members-datasheet-links","title":"Team Members Datasheet links","text":"<p>You can view each team member's individual datasheets by following the links below.

Moisture levels regularly show low % moisture when soil is moist to touch or much higher when tested with other meters (I have several direct reading meters that give results comparable to each other, but different from this meter). I bought three meters of this brand. They give different results when placed side- by- side. Soil fertility remains low even after applying water souluable fertilizer. I don't trust these. The app is of limited value. You must associate each meter with a specific target plant. The app does not include the plant varieties I plant and I can't seem to add any plants to the database. It is difficult to exit the app without signing out. The permissions required to use the app are excessive for a poor quality app. I do appreciate that the app shows a history of records, though I'm not currently confident in the ?daily average? results.

They\u2019re accurate, easy to set up, and basically maintenance-free. Two of mine gave up, but before I could even get annoyed, the seller had replacements on the way. That\u2019s customer service done right. Living in Florida means these sensors sit through daily rain and brutal heat, and they still perform like champs. Well-built, modern, and integrates smoothly into my setup.\u201d 1. Product needs to be accurate and reliable (Explicit)2. Product needs to be durable (Latent) \u201cWe have a midsized back yard garden. I started to use a drip irrigation system last year because hand watering was starting to take a long of time, dragging the hose from bed to bed. These little devices connect to an EcoWitt receiver. I'm using their GW1100 model. Once you have that receiver set up... and it's pretty easy... these moisture sensors find the receiver automatically as soon as you put in the battery. You push them in the ground near the base of the plant you want to monitor and it reports the moisture percentage of the soil back to the receiver about every minute. if you connect your receiver to the EcoWitt weather server, it will log all your data and you can see both the current readings and graph the history of each sensor. So far we have just 4 sensors throughout the garden to sort of give us an overview of each crop. How much is enough is still a question that is yet to be answered. An online search of the proper soil moisture percentage results in a variety of answers, but then don't most online searches. I'm still digging for some more useful answers to that question, because so far the internet says between 20% to 80%. That's quite a range! We trying to stay at around 50% and water when it drops to around 25% and are also keeping an eye on the various plants. I should also confess I like gadgets, so I suppose you could just keep an eye on your plants.\u201d 1. Product needs to be easy to set up and use (Latent)2. Product should have data about target readings (Latent)3. Product needs to save consumer time, and reduce effort (Latent)4. Product needs to log data not just present current measurements (Latent) \u201cI have five of these operating around my home. I live in an area with extremely poor soil conditions that subject my slab-on-grade home to extreme foundation movement if I don\u2019t keep soil moisture consistent season to season. During long, hot summers my soil dries out and causes my foundation to shift dramatically. I bought a couple of these sensors in late summer 2019 to gauge long-term trends to determine ideal soil moisture conditions. After a year of gathering data, I found a good range for soil moisture to minimize foundation movement. I purchased three more (and a WN51) to stake along the perimeter of my home to monitor my soil moisture in real time. By getting this data I\u2019m able to determine when I need to run the soaker hose and irrigation system around my home. While my foundation still moves, I\u2019ve noticed a dramatic difference associated with keeping soil moisture levels within 5-7% of their target. I realize this might not be the targeted use of these devices, but I believe their reliability in my application serves a ringing endorsement for others looking to monitor the moisture levels in their planters in real time. The user interface is average. The app, without a full PWS, seems less than functional. I almost prefer the web-version to the app because it only shows me the active data. This, ultimately isn\u2019t too important to me. If I could export daily data as a .csv, I\u2019d like that ability but it\u2019s not a deal breaker as my primary use is observation of long-term trends. For those with privacy concerns, it\u2019s easily addressed by connected the hub to the internet via a secured guest network. If you\u2019re not already running all of your smart devices on their own secured network away from personal devices, I suggest you do so. I\u2019ve got a couple notes for prospective buyers: 1) I think I prefer this model (WH51) over a similar moisture meter (WN51) made by Ecowitt. These seem more granular in their ability to notice subtle differences in moisture and react much faster to changes in moisture levels. 2) Use a good lithium ion battery. At least two of my sensors have functioned for almost a year without needing to change a battery. They\u2019ve operated in temps from 20-110F. 3) Spend 5 minutes calibrating your devices to the type of soil where the meter will be placed. Mine are primarily in Texas black clay and they require some calibrating tweaking from default. Also, in relation to the first point, the WH51 seems to have a much larger range from 0-100% saturation than the WN51. No clue why, but I like the more precise ability to measure incremental changes in moisture. I\u2019ll update my review over time with any additional notes or issues that may arise.\u201d 1. Product needs to be able to keep an extensive log of data to effectively see data patterns (Latent)2. Product needs long battery life (Explicit)3. Product should include a calibration procedure (Latent)4. Product needs to handle a large range of temperatures (Latent)5. Product should be able to auto water the soil (Latent) \u201cI have about ten fruit trees and 10 blackberry plants, I had them for 3 years and they have come to the large you really need tp manage the water levels to get the most and best fruit. I jumped in head down this year with all the correct fertilizers and oils the plants need but, when it came to the water or moist of the soil it looks dry on the first inch or so but then where the roots are it's wet and you over water. I looked for months on the best products to just have the water level happen automatically each day as needed. I already collect 3300 gallons of rain water from my house so the water has all the natural chemicals needed, I have a pressure pump system to supply my mini sprayers but now how wet is the soil.??? I read up all the descriptions of how to setup and use this system and found next to nothing others then call them if you buy the units and need help. I did not want to waster my time with someone that may not work but, I took a chance and I I glad I did. THEY COULDN'T be easier to pair and install. You simply hook the receiver to your wifi in settings then downland their app next, put a battery in the soil unit wait 30 second and the sending units are seen by the app automatically I WISH other system were this easy you can't make a mistake. Buy these product the are outstanding in every way, attached are some screen shots you can check the soil from location you happen to be at and for me it just press that zone button and my plants are done, I only have to manually press the water button for that zone if the soil is behind dry even after the automatic cycles. GREAT product and , oh by the I own a world wide computer computer and know a GREAT product on the technology side and this rates the highest on ease of setup and results.\u201d 1.

I put the spike in each pot, linked the tubing to each pot and used 2 buckets of water to put the end in for a water source. I programmed it to water every 3 days. When we returned the seedling were perfectly watered and looked great. After trying so many cheap, quirky ways to keep plants moist while away, I was so happy to find this system. It\u2019s worth every cent. It was easy to set up but I did have 30 pots so it took some time. I tested it several times and there was no leakage.\" 1. Product should be expensive and be considered worth its value. (Latent)2. Product should be automated (Explicit)3. Product should have no leakage (Explicit)4. Product should be waterproof (Explicit) \"I have a lot of plants. It brings the beauty of outdoors inside and purifies the air. But what do you do when you go on vacation or if you are so busy you forget to take care of your plants. This automatic watering system could be your answer. It comes with plenty of tubing, \"T\" connectors and watering tubes for up to 20 plants. The setup is explained well in the instructions that come with the kit and videos in the listing so I won't go into detail here. Just be sure you measure out the right lengths of hose before you cut and have a bucket of water that can hold the total amount of water you will need for the duration of the time you will be unable to water the plants yourself. To use this for multiple plants you have to do a little math. The longest you can run each of the pumps each time is 15 minutes. The total amount of water each pump can deliver in that time is 1.5 gallons (24 cups). Per minute, the pump delivers 1.6 cups. If you need more water than that, you can set the pump to run multiple times. You must divide the amount of water by the number of plants you are watering. For example, if you have 4 plants on one pump, the water delivered will be divided by 4. So if the pump is run for the full duration, each plant will get the same amount of water (6 cups). If your plants need less water, you set the run time accordingly. if you cannot divide your plants into 2 groups (1 for each pump) that need the same amount of water you will either need more of these systems or have to look at other options. Bottom line, this is a great watering solution to ensure that your plants survive a vacation or absent mindedness. Calculate your watering needs before purchase to see if this is a good solution for you.\" 1. Product should have a good user manual (Latent)2. Product should have a good battery life and a long run time (Explicit) \"I've been looking for a watering system like the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device for awhile and was pleasantly surprised at the space economy this offers.

Really the only thing you need to add yourself is a water bucket of which my first use for testing purposes was a 1 gallon plastic milk jug. I will at some point be setting this up in a permanent location utilizing a larger 3 gallon, clear water jug. The timer function of the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device is very easy to set up and in my opinion, takes a little experimentation to get just right for various environments where this device will be used. Since each plant has its own unique watering needs for overall plant health and growth, I think a person can easily expand on the device water tubes a little by adding drip emitters for any given particular plant that need less or more water than others in the system. I also like that the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device utilizes both USB and AA battery power which is great feature just in case the power goes out for an extended period of time. Each of the parts included with this device seem to be very quality pieces as well as the timer/pump housing and the water tube connections pieces as well. The functionality of this product just through my initial testing has been outstanding. Overall, if you always want to keep your plants watered and healthy, the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device is a real good start at a very reasonable price point.

It's a bit cheaper than some other systems out there, but it works well. The plants grow fast and healthy. There are several features that make this one stand out: 1) Larger footprint than other 12-pod gardens. While this means that it takes up more space, it also means that the pods are spaced further apart. When you\u2019ve got your garden really growing, having some more space between plants is a big deal. I\u2019d rather lose a few more square inches of table space if it means that the plants have more room. It seems only this garden is designed like this. 2) LED array is really good in this model. The lights are brighter than some of my other gardens, and I\u2019ve seen distinct differences in growth and leaf color based on how bright the lights are. This one is a beast. Also, unlike every other one of my hydroponic gardens, this one has each LED recessed inside individual cells instead of being flush with the bottom of the light fixture. This will help with two things: leaves that grow to the top will not be in contact with the LED and get burned as easily, and the recessed cells direct more of the light down instead of having a lot of it spill out outside of the garden. Your plants will get more of the good stuff! 3) Drain hole on bottom. Only one of my other gardens have this, and it\u2019s very nice. Every couple of months, I like to drain the tanks and refill them with fresh water. Over time, nutrients and gunk may build up in the tank, so a full drain and refill will restore water purity. Having a drain on the bottom makes it a lot easier than lifting the entire grow platform out and dealing with the mess of roots. 4) This hydroponics growing system has a low water level alarm. I\u2019ve forgotten to add water to my tank before when water levels are low, and it\u2019ll effect plant growth. With the alarm, a beep will tell you when you need to water. Very convenient and intuitive! 5) Useful memory function for emergencies. Once my family told me that the power was cut off at home, I was at work and was very worried that the plants would die. When I got home, the machine was still working. The plants were perfectly fine, thanks to the hydroponics system memory. I'm so glad I have it! It really takes the worry out of plant care.\" 1.

Product should be indoor farming accessible (Explicit) \"This is an excellent option. A solid brand that offers more reliability and a warranty unlike ultra cheap generic brands but not NEAR as expensive as the big name brands while still giving you the same quality product. I actually bought two seperate inbloom systems. This large one and a smaller one. Comparing the two side by side this one definitely has a major perk but a few downsides as well. I'm honestly surprised. I would expect the systems to maintain the same quality. The downsides of this are really only compared to the other system of the same brand! The perks - The biggest perk is that if you manually turn the light off it will still keep track of the time and turn on 8 hours later. Living in a rural area the power sometimes flickers. Meaning the system totally resets and the grow lights may be on all night long. With this one I can just tap the light button before bed and 8 hours later it will turn on. With the smaller one if you tap the button it totally turns off the lighting, meaning I must manually turn it on the following day. The water gauge is enclosed in sturdy glass, no need to worry about bumping it. The drawbacks - The pieces between the two systems aren't really interchangeable. The smaller system includes stakes for plants and this one does not. However, the smaller systems stakes are too thick to use in this. I solved this by using chopsticks. The grow baskets are also different sizes. If I get them mixed up the basket for the smaller system will sit about 1cm raised out of the slot of this system. The smaller system is also a little better engineered overall. No knob to raise or lower the lamp. No extra wiring running from the base to the lamp. Small things that make it feel nicer. All in all it's still a great product. A few caveats but nothing I wouldn't notice if I wasn't comparing two products from the same brand. I'd definitely recommend it.\" 1.

I purchased it because we were going to be gone for a month with plants left indoor and I decided to give this product a try. The feeding line would need to be cut for each plant/pot and the only downside in this case is that I will have to have the same setup every time I bring my pots inside but I took pictures and video so I can replicate it next year. Product setup was very easy and it worked great. The app can be designed better for setting up watering frequency but I figured it out. You will need to setup an account if you want to access it while you are away from home else it can also be used with just Bluetooth and you don't need to have an account setup if you want to use it that way. This tells me that company is not interested in collecting your data. It worked so well that after returning back from our trip, I decided to leave it for the rest of the winter and used this system for irrigation. It actually worked better because watering frequency is consistent and you can figure out what works for the plants. In addition, you can setup water flow for each plant by adjusting how much water flow it will need based on the size of the pot and plant. I will be using this every winter for watering my plants. I would highly recommend this product.\" 1. Reliable plant watering system, easy setup, works for indoor plants during extended absences (Explicit)2. Easy to set up, maintains plant health, works via app or Bluetooth (Explicit)3. Peace of mind while away, predictable plant care, non-intrusive (Latent) \"I was looking for something to help water plants while away on long trips and gave this a try based on other reviews. After a lot of trial and error, I am super happy with this product and will share some tips that hopefully help: 1. The product doesn't specify drip rate so this was a little tough to figure out. I use it for my herbs and veggies and found it works well with the drippers wide open and running for 30 min every other day for my veggie plants. For my herbs, I run it for 15 min every other day. For this reason, I like the cycle water feature over the schedule feature. Cycle water allows you to run it every other day, whereas schedule requires you to pick which days of the week you want to run it. This time frame works well for my thirsty tomatoes, peppers and herbs. 2. You can split the hose in multiple directions! I have one pump that branches off in two separate directions and it doesn't affect water flow. This was a lifesaver as I didn't want to buy a third system just for a few herbs. See photos for more details. 3. The unit is waterproof but the plug itself is not. I keep both pumps in a small husky box to keep everything dry. I got a couple railing planter hooks to hold the box off the side of my planter. I keep water in a large plastic tote that fits perfectly under the planter. 4. The anti backflow valve prevented the pump from working. I ditched it and it's been running smoothly ever since. I haven't noticed any issues with leaking, either. Make sure you connect the hose all the way to prevent leaks. 5. Aim the drippers at the base of your plants. I was hoping they would magically water the entire planter, but they only cover a small area. This is part of why I run it for so long. Hang on to your extra hose and drippers! This will be helpful if you add or move plants.\" 1. Customizable watering for different plants, ability to split hoses, waterproof system, avoids overwatering (Explicit)2. Adjustable drip rate, multiple plant watering, waterproof pump, proper setup prevents leaks (Explicit)3. Efficiency in watering diverse plants, low maintenance, minimal worry about leaks (Latent) \"I am using the Letpot watering device in a deep water culture (DWC) grow room. It took about a week to get the watering levels exactly where I wanted them because while you can water multiple plants at one time, there is only one siphon from your water source. So, you have to adjust the flow for each plant accordingly. Very easily done, it just takes a little tweaking. If I was using soil instead of DWC, the proper amount to water is even easier to determine. Great little product that makes my gardening life MUCH easier.\" 1. Precise watering control, works for multiple plants at once, adjustable flow per plant (Explicit)2. Flexibility to water different plant setups (Explicit)3. Optimization for plant growth, minimal manual oversight once set (Latent) \"I was surprised how high quality this is for the price. The tubbing and emitters are really nice.

This kept my plants well hydrated and I am happy to say, my plants all looked healthy when I returned. One issue I had was using the Scheduled Watering feature. It seems more complicated than it needs to be, so I used the Cycle Watering feature instead. Another issue is that the hose connection to the device will leak if you do not properly adjust the water flow of each dripper. This is all explained in the manual.

He often goes to check on the garden. However, new guidelines and a loss of staff from budget cuts mean that no one can go into the garden from Monday to Thursday. In order to save the plants from not being watered for four days, he finds and purchases an automatic watering system. Now he can set the system to automatically water the plants on days they can\u2019t go and check on them, as well as monitor the plants for anything they might need when they gets back. </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"04-Product-Requirements/#aspects","title":"Aspects","text":"<p>Our product will be based on the following aspects and requirements.

We started by discussing how we were going to split this assignment and what we were going to do together. We had decided to make the list of features and rank each idea for the need together and distribute the rest of the work evenly. We decided to take a while and brainstorm different features for our product, as well as rank them based on the different requirements that we had chosen from our previous assignments. During this, all of us contributed to formatting, organizing, and contributing to our excel sheet; which needed to contain a variety of user requirements and needs, as well as ideas of different potential features and details about said features. We had a list of requirements and needs for our plant monitor from a previous assignment, which aided us in coming up with one hundred features for our project as per the assignment guidelines. We took these needs and came up with five unique features for each one. For most of this time, we were looking at the different sections that we could come up with simple and easy-to-make solutions for our product. For the ones that we couldn\u2019t come up with, we turned to the internet and ChatGPT for inspiration. While we mostly got responses with the features we had come up with, it did give us quite a few alternatives and examples of other systems that aided in our brainstorming process. It helped us get ideas for a lot more, and eventually, we had finished our list. We all contributed and made a fair share of ideas for the list, and added details about each idea at a later time. We had some addressing the safety of the product, some that addressed ease of use, as well as some quality of life details. Within these, we addressed the pressing issues of using electronic devices in environments with elements that would cause wear and tear on our system. We addressed how we would deal with potential rain, extreme temperatures, and strong winds that could negatively impact how our device would function in harsh environments over time. For each, we went over different ideas and used ChatGPT to help us generate some ideas for different aspects of the features, such as having a waterproof electronics box. We also had some quality of life requirements, such as an easy-to-use app that allows for multiple systems to connect and work in tandem. These aren\u2019t necessarily needed; however, they are qualities that will set us apart from other options. After we had come up with one hundred user needs, we decided to start ranking the features 1-5 based on the user needs. At this point, we went through the list slowly as a group and decided which features were better ideas than others. We had a few that were easy to decide on, like how we should make the system to refill the water. Some, however, were harder to decide on, like what flow regulators we wanted to use. Often, we had very similar features that were hard to rank because they were incredibly close, or we didn\u2019t have a preference for one over the other. After doing this, we started working on our assigned roles separately throughout the rest of the week. Three of our members worked on sorting the rest of the features and working on their own designs of the products, while one worked on the documentation of this part of our project. Each of the three members who were working on designs took about 20 features from our list of rankings and put them together to make a unique design. They made physical mockups of their design out of materials they had. They also needed to make an electronic vector-created version of their design. For this, they also need to highlight the different features of their project, showcasing the different features that they chose for their project, incorporated into their design. </p> <p>Written By: Rylee Wirt </p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"05-design-ideation/#generating-ideas","title":"Generating Ideas","text":"<p>For our top 20 product requirements, we brainstormed 5 different product features that could be used to satisfy those requirements.

Since this is a project for the EGR 304 class, we need to maintain the class project requirements and build our system so that it can be demonstrated in a lab setting. However, for an actual product, we would ideally make several changes. First, the light sensor would not alert the second it receives low light, but instead measure the readings over a day's time and report its findings to the user the next day, so they could consider moving their plant to receive more sunlight. Then, the speaker subsystem would most likely be replaced with a connection to an app, where, instead of audio alerts, the app would send push notifications to the user so they know the status of their plant without being annoyed by constant sounds coming from the device.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/","title":"Appendix - Main Page","text":"<p>The Appendix is where supporting information goes that is not in the main body.</p>"},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/","title":"Appendix: Team Organization","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#team-goals","title":"Team Goals","text":"<ol> <li>Enhance skills to expand our skillset</li> <li>Learn how to collaborate with a team to make an effective product</li> <li>Minimize product cost and maximize utility</li> <li>Produce reliable, accurate, and professional products</li> <li>Create products that address real issues encountered by customers</li> </ol>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#communication-channels","title":"Communication Channels","text":"<p>Appendix Table 1: Team Member Communication Modes</p> Name First Choice Communication Second Choice Communication Third Choice Communication Jacob Text Phone Email Rylee Text Email Phone Isaiah Text Email Phone Raunak Text Email Phone","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"Appendix/App-Team-Org/#main-method-for-group-communication","title":"Main Method for Group Communication","text":"<p>Based on the information provided in the \"Team Member Communication Modes,\" the group's primary method of communication is text and email for documents and digital media.
