The iPhone app is not bad but it would be nice to allow for historical graphs. The graphing capability for home assistant includes luminance, microsiemens per centimeter, moisture, and temperature.\u201d 1. App can store data and generate historical graphs (Explicit)2. Device will track important data related to the plant (Latent) \u201cThis is very easy to use. Have app installed and insert the device in soil. Perfect to record soil temperature. However it won't give any other information in case of any issues with the plant. Worth the price. Am keep changing every week for all my problematic plants. Wish to buy another one.\u201d 1. App will alert any detectable issues with the plant (Explicit)2. Device can be moved and reprogrammed easily (Latent)3. Price should be worth value of device (Explicit) \u201cI bought three of these about a year ago, and forgot to change the batteries in them. They seem to get about 3 months of battery life, if you aren't syncing then constantly? They work great, though. Only issue with device is that I wish the Bluetooth range was longer. The app, though, could use some work\u2026 You can't create your own plant, though, you have to select from the options and accept the light and water requirements it gives. And it goes by scientific name, but it does let you rename them now\u2026 I just set up my newest one\u2026 still super quick and easy to pair. It's difficult opening the back, but I'm okay with that considering I leave some of them outside in the PNW rains. It also doesn't alert you when things are dry, you have to check on it manually... \u201d 1. Device can have long range connections (Explicit)2. Device will give several types of alerts that could be relevant (Latent)3. User can add custom plants with custom requirements to sensor (Explicit)4. User can rename plants in app (Explicit)5. Device electronics are protected from weather and outdoor elements (Latent) \u201cThe instructions are kind of garbage and direct you to scan a QR code to download the app\u2026 my phone threw up an immediate red flag. I recommend only installing apps that are in the app store\u2026 it works with both the \"Mi Home\" app and \"Flowercare\". Mi Flora is difficult. I was never able to find the sensor to add, so I gave up...another worthless account created out there in the ether. Flowercare was much easier to use, and I was able to add the sensor pretty easily\u2026 About 5 mins later it stopped sending data. Again, ready to send it back. However, I also had the phone app open (which is nice BTW). It can only send to one device at a time. When I closed the phone app, it started sending to HA again. All in all, I'm pleased with it.\u201d 1. Only 1 app for the device that is high quality and user-friendly (Explicit)2. Device connections are stable and stay connected (Latent)3. Instructions for device and app should be well made (Explicit)4. App can connect to several devices at the same time (Latent)","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-User-Needs-and%20Benchmarking/#negative-comments","title":"Negative Comments","text":"Voice of the Customer Restated Customer Need \u201cI so wanted to give this a high rating, however the app won't download for the latest version of Android, so it's basically useless.\u201d 1.

Look at the app it asks you to download \u201cflower care\u201d and it has abysmal reviews all mentioning the connection issues and broke functionality. Several report the sensors just stop working as well.\u201d 1. Sensors keep working for a long time (Explicit) \u201cMine died quickly. I've removed the app. Would not recommend\u2026 I'm using them outdoors, dry summer, in 1 foot deep standing boxes. I found them hard to set up and hard to connect requiring many attempts to reconnect before success whether inside or our next to the device, even when holding the device in hand. Moisture levels regularly show low % moisture when soil is moist to touch or much higher when tested with other meters (I have several direct reading meters that give results comparable to each other, but different from this meter). I bought three meters of this brand. They give different results when placed side- by- side. Soil fertility remains low even after applying water souluable fertilizer. I don't trust these. The app is of limited value. You must associate each meter with a specific target plant. The app does not include the plant varieties I plant and I can't seem to add any plants to the database. It is difficult to exit the app without signing out. The permissions required to use the app are excessive for a poor quality app. I do appreciate that the app shows a history of records, though I'm not currently confident in the ?daily average? results. I would prefer a more open app, friendlier permissions with easy opt out provisions, a longer probe to at least 8\" depth, more consistent results, better connection success. I do not recommend this version\u2026 I'll be looking for improved versions.\u201d 1. App allows the user to opt-out of permissions and is designed with user privacy in mind (Explicit)2.
