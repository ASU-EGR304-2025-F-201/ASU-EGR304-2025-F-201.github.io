Moisture levels regularly show low % moisture when soil is moist to touch or much higher when tested with other meters (I have several direct reading meters that give results comparable to each other, but different from this meter). I bought three meters of this brand. They give different results when placed side- by- side. Soil fertility remains low even after applying water souluable fertilizer. I don't trust these. The app is of limited value. You must associate each meter with a specific target plant. The app does not include the plant varieties I plant and I can't seem to add any plants to the database. It is difficult to exit the app without signing out. The permissions required to use the app are excessive for a poor quality app. I do appreciate that the app shows a history of records, though I'm not currently confident in the ?daily average? results.

They\u2019re accurate, easy to set up, and basically maintenance-free. Two of mine gave up, but before I could even get annoyed, the seller had replacements on the way. That\u2019s customer service done right. Living in Florida means these sensors sit through daily rain and brutal heat, and they still perform like champs. Well-built, modern, and integrates smoothly into my setup.\u201d 1. Product needs to be accurate and reliable (Explicit)2. Product needs to be durable (Latent) \u201cWe have a midsized back yard garden. I started to use a drip irrigation system last year because hand watering was starting to take a long of time, dragging the hose from bed to bed. These little devices connect to an EcoWitt receiver. I'm using their GW1100 model. Once you have that receiver set up... and it's pretty easy... these moisture sensors find the receiver automatically as soon as you put in the battery. You push them in the ground near the base of the plant you want to monitor and it reports the moisture percentage of the soil back to the receiver about every minute. if you connect your receiver to the EcoWitt weather server, it will log all your data and you can see both the current readings and graph the history of each sensor. So far we have just 4 sensors throughout the garden to sort of give us an overview of each crop. How much is enough is still a question that is yet to be answered. An online search of the proper soil moisture percentage results in a variety of answers, but then don't most online searches. I'm still digging for some more useful answers to that question, because so far the internet says between 20% to 80%. That's quite a range! We trying to stay at around 50% and water when it drops to around 25% and are also keeping an eye on the various plants. I should also confess I like gadgets, so I suppose you could just keep an eye on your plants.\u201d 1. Product needs to be easy to set up and use (Latent)2. Product should have data about target readings (Latent)3. Product needs to save consumer time, and reduce effort (Latent)4. Product needs to log data not just present current measurements (Latent) \u201cI have five of these operating around my home. I live in an area with extremely poor soil conditions that subject my slab-on-grade home to extreme foundation movement if I don\u2019t keep soil moisture consistent season to season. During long, hot summers my soil dries out and causes my foundation to shift dramatically. I bought a couple of these sensors in late summer 2019 to gauge long-term trends to determine ideal soil moisture conditions. After a year of gathering data, I found a good range for soil moisture to minimize foundation movement. I purchased three more (and a WN51) to stake along the perimeter of my home to monitor my soil moisture in real time. By getting this data I\u2019m able to determine when I need to run the soaker hose and irrigation system around my home. While my foundation still moves, I\u2019ve noticed a dramatic difference associated with keeping soil moisture levels within 5-7% of their target. I realize this might not be the targeted use of these devices, but I believe their reliability in my application serves a ringing endorsement for others looking to monitor the moisture levels in their planters in real time. The user interface is average. The app, without a full PWS, seems less than functional. I almost prefer the web-version to the app because it only shows me the active data. This, ultimately isn\u2019t too important to me. If I could export daily data as a .csv, I\u2019d like that ability but it\u2019s not a deal breaker as my primary use is observation of long-term trends. For those with privacy concerns, it\u2019s easily addressed by connected the hub to the internet via a secured guest network. If you\u2019re not already running all of your smart devices on their own secured network away from personal devices, I suggest you do so. I\u2019ve got a couple notes for prospective buyers: 1) I think I prefer this model (WH51) over a similar moisture meter (WN51) made by Ecowitt. These seem more granular in their ability to notice subtle differences in moisture and react much faster to changes in moisture levels. 2) Use a good lithium ion battery. At least two of my sensors have functioned for almost a year without needing to change a battery. They\u2019ve operated in temps from 20-110F. 3) Spend 5 minutes calibrating your devices to the type of soil where the meter will be placed. Mine are primarily in Texas black clay and they require some calibrating tweaking from default. Also, in relation to the first point, the WH51 seems to have a much larger range from 0-100% saturation than the WN51. No clue why, but I like the more precise ability to measure incremental changes in moisture. I\u2019ll update my review over time with any additional notes or issues that may arise.\u201d 1. Product needs to be able to keep an extensive log of data to effectively see data patterns (Latent)2. Product needs long battery life (Explicit)3. Product should include a calibration procedure (Latent)4. Product needs to handle a large range of temperatures (Latent)5. Product should be able to auto water the soil (Latent) \u201cI have about ten fruit trees and 10 blackberry plants, I had them for 3 years and they have come to the large you really need tp manage the water levels to get the most and best fruit. I jumped in head down this year with all the correct fertilizers and oils the plants need but, when it came to the water or moist of the soil it looks dry on the first inch or so but then where the roots are it's wet and you over water. I looked for months on the best products to just have the water level happen automatically each day as needed. I already collect 3300 gallons of rain water from my house so the water has all the natural chemicals needed, I have a pressure pump system to supply my mini sprayers but now how wet is the soil.??? I read up all the descriptions of how to setup and use this system and found next to nothing others then call them if you buy the units and need help. I did not want to waster my time with someone that may not work but, I took a chance and I I glad I did. THEY COULDN'T be easier to pair and install. You simply hook the receiver to your wifi in settings then downland their app next, put a battery in the soil unit wait 30 second and the sending units are seen by the app automatically I WISH other system were this easy you can't make a mistake. Buy these product the are outstanding in every way, attached are some screen shots you can check the soil from location you happen to be at and for me it just press that zone button and my plants are done, I only have to manually press the water button for that zone if the soil is behind dry even after the automatic cycles.

I put the spike in each pot, linked the tubing to each pot and used 2 buckets of water to put the end in for a water source. I programmed it to water every 3 days. When we returned the seedling were perfectly watered and looked great. After trying so many cheap, quirky ways to keep plants moist while away, I was so happy to find this system. It\u2019s worth every cent. It was easy to set up but I did have 30 pots so it took some time. I tested it several times and there was no leakage.\" 1. Product should be expensive and be considered worth its value. (Latent)2. Product should be automated (Explicit)3. Product should have no leakage (Explicit)4. Product should be waterproof (Explicit) \"I have a lot of plants. It brings the beauty of outdoors inside and purifies the air. But what do you do when you go on vacation or if you are so busy you forget to take care of your plants. This automatic watering system could be your answer. It comes with plenty of tubing, \"T\" connectors and watering tubes for up to 20 plants. The setup is explained well in the instructions that come with the kit and videos in the listing so I won't go into detail here. Just be sure you measure out the right lengths of hose before you cut and have a bucket of water that can hold the total amount of water you will need for the duration of the time you will be unable to water the plants yourself. To use this for multiple plants you have to do a little math. The longest you can run each of the pumps each time is 15 minutes. The total amount of water each pump can deliver in that time is 1.5 gallons (24 cups). Per minute, the pump delivers 1.6 cups. If you need more water than that, you can set the pump to run multiple times. You must divide the amount of water by the number of plants you are watering. For example, if you have 4 plants on one pump, the water delivered will be divided by 4. So if the pump is run for the full duration, each plant will get the same amount of water (6 cups). If your plants need less water, you set the run time accordingly. if you cannot divide your plants into 2 groups (1 for each pump) that need the same amount of water you will either need more of these systems or have to look at other options. Bottom line, this is a great watering solution to ensure that your plants survive a vacation or absent mindedness. Calculate your watering needs before purchase to see if this is a good solution for you.\" 1. Product should have a good user manual (Latent)2.

Really the only thing you need to add yourself is a water bucket of which my first use for testing purposes was a 1 gallon plastic milk jug. I will at some point be setting this up in a permanent location utilizing a larger 3 gallon, clear water jug. The timer function of the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device is very easy to set up and in my opinion, takes a little experimentation to get just right for various environments where this device will be used. Since each plant has its own unique watering needs for overall plant health and growth, I think a person can easily expand on the device water tubes a little by adding drip emitters for any given particular plant that need less or more water than others in the system. I also like that the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device utilizes both USB and AA battery power which is great feature just in case the power goes out for an extended period of time. Each of the parts included with this device seem to be very quality pieces as well as the timer/pump housing and the water tube connections pieces as well. The functionality of this product just through my initial testing has been outstanding. Overall, if you always want to keep your plants watered and healthy, the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device is a real good start at a very reasonable price point.

It's a bit cheaper than some other systems out there, but it works well. The plants grow fast and healthy. There are several features that make this one stand out: 1) Larger footprint than other 12-pod gardens. While this means that it takes up more space, it also means that the pods are spaced further apart. When you\u2019ve got your garden really growing, having some more space between plants is a big deal. I\u2019d rather lose a few more square inches of table space if it means that the plants have more room. It seems only this garden is designed like this. 2) LED array is really good in this model. The lights are brighter than some of my other gardens, and I\u2019ve seen distinct differences in growth and leaf color based on how bright the lights are. This one is a beast. Also, unlike every other one of my hydroponic gardens, this one has each LED recessed inside individual cells instead of being flush with the bottom of the light fixture. This will help with two things: leaves that grow to the top will not be in contact with the LED and get burned as easily, and the recessed cells direct more of the light down instead of having a lot of it spill out outside of the garden. Your plants will get more of the good stuff! 3) Drain hole on bottom. Only one of my other gardens have this, and it\u2019s very nice. Every couple of months, I like to drain the tanks and refill them with fresh water. Over time, nutrients and gunk may build up in the tank, so a full drain and refill will restore water purity. Having a drain on the bottom makes it a lot easier than lifting the entire grow platform out and dealing with the mess of roots. 4) This hydroponics growing system has a low water level alarm. I\u2019ve forgotten to add water to my tank before when water levels are low, and it\u2019ll effect plant growth. With the alarm, a beep will tell you when you need to water. Very convenient and intuitive! 5) Useful memory function for emergencies. Once my family told me that the power was cut off at home, I was at work and was very worried that the plants would die. When I got home, the machine was still working. The plants were perfectly fine, thanks to the hydroponics system memory. I'm so glad I have it! It really takes the worry out of plant care.\" 1.

A solid brand that offers more reliability and a warranty unlike ultra cheap generic brands but not NEAR as expensive as the big name brands while still giving you the same quality product. I actually bought two seperate inbloom systems. This large one and a smaller one. Comparing the two side by side this one definitely has a major perk but a few downsides as well. I'm honestly surprised. I would expect the systems to maintain the same quality. The downsides of this are really only compared to the other system of the same brand! The perks - The biggest perk is that if you manually turn the light off it will still keep track of the time and turn on 8 hours later. Living in a rural area the power sometimes flickers. Meaning the system totally resets and the grow lights may be on all night long. With this one I can just tap the light button before bed and 8 hours later it will turn on. With the smaller one if you tap the button it totally turns off the lighting, meaning I must manually turn it on the following day. The water gauge is enclosed in sturdy glass, no need to worry about bumping it. The drawbacks - The pieces between the two systems aren't really interchangeable. The smaller system includes stakes for plants and this one does not. However, the smaller systems stakes are too thick to use in this. I solved this by using chopsticks. The grow baskets are also different sizes. If I get them mixed up the basket for the smaller system will sit about 1cm raised out of the slot of this system. The smaller system is also a little better engineered overall. No knob to raise or lower the lamp. No extra wiring running from the base to the lamp. Small things that make it feel nicer. All in all it's still a great product. A few caveats but nothing I wouldn't notice if I wasn't comparing two products from the same brand. I'd definitely recommend it.\" 1.
