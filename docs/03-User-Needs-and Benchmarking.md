| “If you have Home Assistant and BLE working, this product is awesome. The iPhone app is not bad but it would be nice to allow for historical graphs. The graphing capability for home assistant includes luminance, microsiemens per centimeter, moisture, and temperature.” | 1. App can store data and generate historical graphs (Explicit)<br>2. Device will track important data related to the plant (Latent) |
| “This is very easy to use. Have app installed and insert the device in soil. Perfect to record soil temperature. However it won't give any other information in case of any issues with the plant. Worth the price. Am keep changing every week for all my problematic plants. Wish to buy another one.” | 1. App will alert any detectable issues with the plant (Explicit)<br>2. Device can be moved and reprogrammed easily (Latent)<br>3. Price should be worth value of device (Explicit) |
| “I bought three of these about a year ago, and forgot to change the batteries in them. They seem to get about 3 months of battery life, if you aren't syncing then constantly? They work great, though. Only issue with device is that I wish the Bluetooth range was longer. The app, though, could use some work… You can't create your own plant, though, you have to select from the options and accept the light and water requirements it gives. And it goes by scientific name, but it does let you rename them now… I just set up my newest one… still super quick and easy to pair. It's difficult opening the back, but I'm okay with that considering I leave some of them outside in the PNW rains. It also doesn't alert you when things are dry, you have to check on it manually... ” | 1. Device can have long range connections (Explicit)<br>2. Device will give several types of alerts that could be relevant (Latent)<br>3. User can add custom plants with custom requirements to sensor (Explicit)<br>4. User can rename plants in app (Explicit)<br>5. Device electronics are protected from weather and outdoor elements (Latent) |
| “The instructions are kind of garbage and direct you to scan a QR code to download the app… my phone threw up an immediate red flag. I recommend only installing apps that are in the app store… it works with both the "Mi Home" app and "Flowercare". Mi Flora is difficult. I was never able to find the sensor to add, so I gave up...another worthless account created out there in the ether. Flowercare was much easier to use, and I was able to add the sensor pretty easily… About 5 mins later it stopped sending data. Again, ready to send it back. However, I also had the phone app open (which is nice BTW). It can only send to one device at a time. When I closed the phone app, it started sending to HA again. All in all, I'm pleased with it.” | 1. Only 1 app for the device that is high quality and user-friendly (Explicit)<br>2. Device connections are stable and stay connected (Latent)<br>3. Instructions for device and app should be well made (Explicit)<br>4. App can connect to several devices at the same time (Latent) |

| “I so wanted to give this a high rating, however the app won't download for the latest version of Android, so it's basically useless.” | 1. App stay up to date so it keeps working (Explicit)<br>2. App can be backwards compatible with older phones (Latent) |
| “Do not buy!!! Look at the app it asks you to download “flower care” and it has abysmal reviews all mentioning the connection issues and broke functionality. Several report the sensors just stop working as well.” | 1. Sensors keep working for a long time (Explicit) |
| “Mine died quickly. I've removed the app. Would not recommend… I'm using them outdoors, dry summer, in 1 foot deep standing boxes. I found them hard to set up and hard to connect requiring many attempts to reconnect before success whether inside or our next to the device, even when holding the device in hand. Moisture levels regularly show low % moisture when soil is moist to touch or much higher when tested with other meters (I have several direct reading meters that give results comparable to each other, but different from this meter). I bought three meters of this brand. They give different results when placed side- by- side. Soil fertility remains low even after applying water souluable fertilizer. I don't trust these. The app is of limited value. You must associate each meter with a specific target plant. The app does not include the plant varieties I plant and I can't seem to add any plants to the database. It is difficult to exit the app without signing out. The permissions required to use the app are excessive for a poor quality app. I do appreciate that the app shows a history of records, though I'm not currently confident in the ?daily average? results. I would prefer a more open app, friendlier permissions with easy opt out provisions, a longer probe to at least 8" depth, more consistent results, better connection success. I do not recommend this version… I'll be looking for improved versions.” | 1. App allows the user to opt-out of permissions and is designed with user privacy in mind (Explicit)<br>2. Sensor can reach into deep soil for better readings (Explicit)<br>3. Sensors give accurate and consistent information (Explicit) |

| “I own a bunch of these. They’re accurate, easy to set up, and basically maintenance-free. Two of mine gave up, but before I could even get annoyed, the seller had replacements on the way. That’s customer service done right. Living in Florida means these sensors sit through daily rain and brutal heat, and they still perform like champs. Well-built, modern, and integrates smoothly into my setup.” | 1. Product needs to be accurate and reliable (Explicit)<br>2. Product needs to be durable (Latent) |
| “We have a midsized back yard garden. I started to use a drip irrigation system last year because hand watering was starting to take a long of time, dragging the hose from bed to bed. These little devices connect to an EcoWitt receiver. I'm using their GW1100 model. Once you have that receiver set up... and it's pretty easy... these moisture sensors find the receiver automatically as soon as you put in the battery. You push them in the ground near the base of the plant you want to monitor and it reports the moisture percentage of the soil back to the receiver about every minute. if you connect your receiver to the EcoWitt weather server, it will log all your data and you can see both the current readings and graph the history of each sensor. So far we have just 4 sensors throughout the garden to sort of give us an overview of each crop. How much is enough is still a question that is yet to be answered. An online search of the proper soil moisture percentage results in a variety of answers, but then don't most online searches. I'm still digging for some more useful answers to that question, because so far the internet says between 20% to 80%. That's quite a range! We trying to stay at around 50% and water when it drops to around 25% and are also keeping an eye on the various plants. I should also confess I like gadgets, so I suppose you could just keep an eye on your plants.” | 1. Product needs to be easy to set up and use (Latent)<br>2. Product should have data about target readings (Latent)<br>3. Product needs to save consumer time, and reduce effort (Latent)<br>4. Product needs to log data not just present current measurements (Latent) |
| “I have five of these operating around my home. I live in an area with extremely poor soil conditions that subject my slab-on-grade home to extreme foundation movement if I don’t keep soil moisture consistent season to season. During long, hot summers my soil dries out and causes my foundation to shift dramatically. I bought a couple of these sensors in late summer 2019 to gauge long-term trends to determine ideal soil moisture conditions. After a year of gathering data, I found a good range for soil moisture to minimize foundation movement. I purchased three more (and a WN51) to stake along the perimeter of my home to monitor my soil moisture in real time. By getting this data I’m able to determine when I need to run the soaker hose and irrigation system around my home. While my foundation still moves, I’ve noticed a dramatic difference associated with keeping soil moisture levels within 5-7% of their target. I realize this might not be the targeted use of these devices, but I believe their reliability in my application serves a ringing endorsement for others looking to monitor the moisture levels in their planters in real time. The user interface is average. The app, without a full PWS, seems less than functional. I almost prefer the web-version to the app because it only shows me the active data. This, ultimately isn’t too important to me. If I could export daily data as a .csv, I’d like that ability but it’s not a deal breaker as my primary use is observation of long-term trends. For those with privacy concerns, it’s easily addressed by connected the hub to the internet via a secured guest network. If you’re not already running all of your smart devices on their own secured network away from personal devices, I suggest you do so. I’ve got a couple notes for prospective buyers: 1) I think I prefer this model (WH51) over a similar moisture meter (WN51) made by Ecowitt. These seem more granular in their ability to notice subtle differences in moisture and react much faster to changes in moisture levels. 2) Use a good lithium ion battery. At least two of my sensors have functioned for almost a year without needing to change a battery. They’ve operated in temps from 20-110F. 3) Spend 5 minutes calibrating your devices to the type of soil where the meter will be placed. Mine are primarily in Texas black clay and they require some calibrating tweaking from default. Also, in relation to the first point, the WH51 seems to have a much larger range from 0-100% saturation than the WN51. No clue why, but I like the more precise ability to measure incremental changes in moisture. I’ll update my review over time with any additional notes or issues that may arise.” | 1. Product needs to be able to keep an extensive log of data to effectively see data patterns (Latent)<br>2. Product needs long battery life (Explicit)<br>3. Product should include a calibration procedure (Latent)<br>4. Product needs to handle a large range of temperatures (Latent)<br>5. Product should be able to auto water the soil (Latent) |
| “I have about ten fruit trees and 10 blackberry plants, I had them for 3 years and they have come to the large you really need tp manage the water levels to get the most and best fruit. I jumped in head down this year with all the correct fertilizers and oils the plants need but, when it came to the water or moist of the soil it looks dry on the first inch or so but then where the roots are it's wet and you over water. I looked for months on the best products to just have the water level happen automatically each day as needed. I already collect 3300 gallons of rain water from my house so the water has all the natural chemicals needed, I have a pressure pump system to supply my mini sprayers but now how wet is the soil.??? I read up all the descriptions of how to setup and use this system and found next to nothing others then call them if you buy the units and need help. I did not want to waster my time with someone that may not work but, I took a chance and I I glad I did. THEY COULDN'T be easier to pair and install. You simply hook the receiver to your wifi in settings then downland their app next, put a battery in the soil unit wait 30 second and the sending units are seen by the app automatically I WISH other system were this easy you can't make a mistake. Buy these product the are outstanding in every way, attached are some screen shots you can check the soil from location you happen to be at and for me it just press that zone button and my plants are done, I only have to manually press the water button for that zone if the soil is behind dry even after the automatic cycles. GREAT product and , oh by the I own a world wide computer computer and know a GREAT product on the technology side and this rates the highest on ease of setup and results.” | 1. Product needs to be easy to set up and use. No technical skills should be required (Explicit) |
