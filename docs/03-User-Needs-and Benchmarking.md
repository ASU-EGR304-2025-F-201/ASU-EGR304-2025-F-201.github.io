| “If you have Home Assistant and BLE working, this product is awesome. The iPhone app is not bad but it would be nice to allow for historical graphs. The graphing capability for home assistant includes luminance, microsiemens per centimeter, moisture, and temperature.” | 1. App can store data and generate historical graphs (Explicit)<br>2. Device will track important data related to the plant (Latent) |
| “This is very easy to use. Have app installed and insert the device in soil. Perfect to record soil temperature. However it won't give any other information in case of any issues with the plant. Worth the price. Am keep changing every week for all my problematic plants. Wish to buy another one.” | 1. App will alert any detectable issues with the plant (Explicit)<br>2. Device can be moved and reprogrammed easily (Latent)<br>3. Price should be worth value of device (Explicit) |
| “I bought three of these about a year ago, and forgot to change the batteries in them. They seem to get about 3 months of battery life, if you aren't syncing then constantly? They work great, though. Only issue with device is that I wish the Bluetooth range was longer. The app, though, could use some work… You can't create your own plant, though, you have to select from the options and accept the light and water requirements it gives. And it goes by scientific name, but it does let you rename them now… I just set up my newest one… still super quick and easy to pair. It's difficult opening the back, but I'm okay with that considering I leave some of them outside in the PNW rains. It also doesn't alert you when things are dry, you have to check on it manually... ” | 1. Device can have long range connections (Explicit)<br>2. Device will give several types of alerts that could be relevant (Latent)<br>3. User can add custom plants with custom requirements to sensor (Explicit)<br>4. User can rename plants in app (Explicit)<br>5. Device electronics are protected from weather and outdoor elements (Latent) |
| “The instructions are kind of garbage and direct you to scan a QR code to download the app… my phone threw up an immediate red flag. I recommend only installing apps that are in the app store… it works with both the "Mi Home" app and "Flowercare". Mi Flora is difficult. I was never able to find the sensor to add, so I gave up...another worthless account created out there in the ether. Flowercare was much easier to use, and I was able to add the sensor pretty easily… About 5 mins later it stopped sending data. Again, ready to send it back. However, I also had the phone app open (which is nice BTW). It can only send to one device at a time. When I closed the phone app, it started sending to HA again. All in all, I'm pleased with it.” | 1. Only 1 app for the device that is high quality and user-friendly (Explicit)<br>2. Device connections are stable and stay connected (Latent)<br>3. Instructions for device and app should be well made (Explicit)<br>4. App can connect to several devices at the same time (Latent) |
