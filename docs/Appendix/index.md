Located in the links below are two vidoes demonstrating our teams ability to send data between subsystems. 

# Light Sensor
The light sensor connects to the speaker sending a high signal while the sensor (plant) is receiving adaquate light, keeping the speaker off. When the sensor is not recieving enough light a low signal gets sent and the speaker sounds.

# Speaker
The speaker subsystem recieves input from both the light sensor and the moisture sensor. The speaker will sound with a particular tone if it receives a low signal from the light sensor, and a different tone if the signal from the moisture sensor stops. These different tone will prompt the user to either move the plant to more sunlight or to check the moisture sensor.

# Motor
The motor will control the pump to irrigate the plants. When the motor recives a high signal from the moisture sensor it will rotate to irrigate the plant. When ther motor receives a low signal from the moisture sensor it will rotate the opposite direction stopping the flow of water.

# Moisture Sensor
In the video the moisture sensor simulates drying soil. When the soil reaches a critical moisture threshold it sens a high signal to the motor to turn it on. While this happens a constant high status signal is sent to the speaker board as a proof of life of the moisture sensor. If the moisture sensor breaks the speaker will sound.

# Videos
The two videos demonstrating the testing are in the following links.
