### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is text and email for documents and digital media. The team will use phone calls as a secondary means of comunication.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. The primary channel for comunication will be via text. Documents and digital media will be shared via email or dropbox. Phone calls will be used as a tertiary communication method. The members of the team will avoid, when possible, sending texts after 9pm. If a team member is unable to be reached via text, during a time it would be reasonable to assume they could answer, or in the case they are late for a meeting, a phone call will be made to the missing member.
2. When correspondance with the instructor is required it will be handeled by the team leader. The team leader will relay the information to the team via text and/or address the information in the next meeting.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

In the event of an internal team conflict the team will call a meeting and the issue will be discused. The team will work together to develope a plan to address and move passed the conflict. The exact nature of how this will be done will depend on each individual situation.
Example: A team member has an idea of how to move forward with the project, one member agrees, the other two do not. A meeting will be called the following day and both sides will present their case. The issue will be put to a vote and the team will abide by the outcome of the vote. In the event of a tie, each side of the conflict will make a pros cons list of the oppositions idea and a second vote will be taken. If team members do not fully attempt to make a pros cons list of the other side it will be an automatic rejection of their sides idea. If after a second vote there is still a tie the team leader will schedule a meeting during office hours in order to have an unbiased mediator to assist in the resolution.
