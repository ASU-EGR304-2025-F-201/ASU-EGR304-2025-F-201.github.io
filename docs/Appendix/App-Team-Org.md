### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group's primary method of communication is text and email for documents and digital media. The team will use phone calls as a secondary means of communication.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. The primary channel for communication will be via text. Documents and digital media will be shared via email or Dropbox. Phone calls will be used as a tertiary communication method. The members of the team will avoid, when possible, sending texts after 9:00 pm. If a team member is unable to be reached via text, during a time when it would be reasonable to assume they could answer, or in the case they are late for a meeting, a phone call will be made to the missing member.
2. When correspondence with the instructor is required, it will be handled by the team leader. The team leader will relay the information to the team via text and/or address the information in the next meeting.

## Team Coordination & Accountability

We will use our meetings to discuss what the expected deliverables of each member are for each team assignment. This will be recorded and saved so we can refer back to it as we work on the assignments. We will use text to share when we are done with our work and are satisfied with our sections. We will also use meetings to share openly what work we feel comfortable doing, and what work we feel like we cannot do, in which case the team will redecide how to best split the workload accordingly.

If a team member is not contributing to an assignment, we will ensure that we bring this up openly and without anger or resentment in our meetings. We will all be open to feedback and recognize when we failed to complete our tasks, and work on improving. If a team member does not complete their work by the time it is due, their lack of assistance will be shared with the Teaching Team to explain the situation. If needed, a meeting with the Teaching Team will be scheduled to discuss the team dynamics in the event of a team member "ghosting" or repeatedly failing to meet deadlines. We will approach all conflicts with understanding, and follow our conflict guidelines.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

In the event of an internal team conflict, the team will call a meeting, and the issue will be discussed. The team will work together to develop a plan to address and move past the conflict. The exact nature of how this will be done will depend on each individual situation.
Example: A team member has an idea of how to move forward with the project, one member agrees, the other two do not. A meeting will be called the following day, and both sides will present their case. The issue will be put to a vote, and the team will abide by the outcome of the vote. In the event of a tie, each side of the conflict will make a pros and cons list of the opposition's idea, and a second vote will be taken. If team members do not fully attempt to make a pros and cons list of the other side, it will be an automatic rejection of their side's idea. If, after a second vote, there is still a tie, the team leader will schedule a meeting during office hours in order to have an unbiased mediator to assist in the resolution.
