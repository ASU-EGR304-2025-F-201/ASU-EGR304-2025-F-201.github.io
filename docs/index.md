## Team Introduction and Project Summary
We are Team 201, and we are tasked with designing a product to help streamline our customers' home lives. You can find out more about our team in the ["Team Organization"](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-201.github.io/02-Team-Organization/) section of this website.
<br>
Our team was tasked with developing a product that can improve and streamline our customers' day-to-day lives. As a team, we decided to make a device that would help our users with their gardening needs. We want to help anyone, from house plant owners to small-scale farmers, streamline the care of their plants through a useful sensing device. The constraints for this project are for each of us to develop either a sensing or actuating subsystem for the device that would help meet the user needs and product requirements of our customers. Once we have designed these subsystems, after considering all of the feedback we receive, we are going to create prototype PCBs to verify the functionality of our device. We will consider this project a success if we create a system of four collaborative boards that all function together to achieve our project's defined goals.


## Team Members Datasheet links
You can view each team member's individual datasheets by following the links below. Each datasheet goes into detail about that team member's specific subsystem and how they designed and verified its functionality. Please take the time to review them to get a more in-depth understanding of our project.
