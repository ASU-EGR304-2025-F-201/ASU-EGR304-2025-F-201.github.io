## Team Charter

As a team, we discussed what our priorities were from this class and team project, and distilled our ideas into a Team Charter. This comprises our goals and aspirations for the scope of our project. You can find more about this in the ["Appendix"](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-201.github.io/Appendix/App-Team-Org/).

>Team 201 is dedicated to designing and producing the highest quality products for our customers. We value growing our individual skills and incorporating those skills to create a stronger, cohesive team. Team 201 prioritizes providing solutions to and solving the problems of our customers.


## Product Mission Statement

As a team, we created a one-sentence statement that defines our goal with this project. We hope this statement explains what we hope to achieve with our product.

>Team 201's mission is to design a user-oriented, efficient, and well-made product that will ease the at-home gardening lives of our customers.
