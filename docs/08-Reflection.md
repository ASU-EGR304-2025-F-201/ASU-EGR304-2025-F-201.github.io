## Lessons Learned

1. When generating ideas, it's important to stay organized and document the process. The better and more thorough the idea generation and benchmarking the smoother the design process will go.
2. Breadboard early and often to ensure the circuitry will work and the subsystem and product will function.
3. Ensure the product is being constantly worked on, tested, and improved.
4. Document everything, at the end of each session of work make notes on what needs to be changed and updated in the digital documentation.
5. Start hardware–software co-development early, don’t wait for final hardware to start firmware logic. Even partial schematics or simulated signals can be enough to begin writing, testing, and refining control structures. When hardware finally arrives, the software is already stable.
6. Build subsystems within subsystems so they can be tested independently, designing each subsystem so that it can be verified in isolation before integrating. This prevents cascading problems and reduces debugging time dramatically.
7. Version-control everything, store KiCad files, code, PDFs, lab notes, and firmware versions in a systematic manner so that when it's time to integrate everything, it doesn't jumble up.
8. Label everything on the schematic with purpose, not just values for components.
9. Set up consistent meetings to make sure that everyone is on task and continuing to do the project properly.
10. Make sure that every change is in accordance with the design and project requirements so as not to back yourself into a corner and have to restart the design process.

## Recommendations for Future Students

1. Use simulation tools before wiring, like LTspice. Simulating power rails or PWM duty effects catches conceptual errors early.
2. Prioritize clarity in wire management.
3. Make sure that your subsystem meets the project requirements before even starting to create a schematic, so you don't have to redo work.
4. Check that you and your teammates understand every component and part that you will all be using, such as microcontroller subsystems or connectors.
5. Go to office hours as much as possible, as the professors and TAs are very helpful with keeping you and your team on track.
