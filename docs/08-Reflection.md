## Lessons Learned

1. When generating ideas its important to stay organized and document the process. The better and more thorough the idea generation and benchmarking the smoother the design process will go.
2. Breadboard early and often to ensure the circuitry will work and the subsystem and product will fucntion.
3. Ensure the product is being constantly worked on, tested, and improved.
4. Document everything, at the end of each session of work make notes on what needs to be changed and updated in the digital documentation.
5. Start hardware–software co-development early, don’t wait for final hardware to start firmware logic. Even partial schematics or simulated signals can be enough to begin writing, testing, and refining control structures. When hardware finally arrives, the software is already stable.
6. Build subsystems within subsystems so they can be tested independently, designing each subsystem so they can be verified in isolation before integrating. This prevents cascading problems and reduces debugging time dramatically.
7. Version-control everything, store KiCad files, code, PDFs, lab notes, and firmware versions in a systematic manner so when it's time to integrate everything doesn't jumble up.
8. Label everything on the schematic with purpose, not just value.

## Recommendations for Future Students

1. Use simulation tools before wiring likes LTspice. Simulating power rails or PWM duty effects catches conceptual errors early.
2. Prioritize clarity in wire management.
