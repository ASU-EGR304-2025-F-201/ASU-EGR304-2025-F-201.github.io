## Project Objective

This project will develop automated, user-customizable irrigation systems. The goal is to enable users to save time and effort while providing crop and hobby plants with more optimal irrigation, while minimizing water waste. We believe offering farmers and hobbyists high-quality smart irrigation will help them maximize crop yield and minimize wasted time and money. Our user-customizable libraries will enable the customer to monitor and adjust irrigation to their exact needs. Our aim is to offer higher quality and more degrees of customization than any other smart irrigation system on the market. We will offer waterproofing and battery life at least equal to our competitors. Our rugged and durable design will help our smart irrigation system outlast all others.

## Use Cases

### User Story #1: Sabrina
Sabrina is a 19-year-old college student who is living in an apartment. As she doesn’t get much outside time she decides to get some plants to give her some nice decoration in her room. However, after a long and tough week of classes she realizes that she forgot to water her plants. They’re now in a bad state and will take time and more resources to recover. She doesn’t want to forget to water her plants again when she gets busy with her life obligations. She decides to get a system that will water and fertilize her plants for her so she can keep her vibrant decorations along with taking some responsibility and stress away from her.

Sabrina is an out-of-state college student who has many plants in her parent’s home. She wants to be able to take care of them while still being at college, since her parents don’t know how to take care of them as well as she can. She decides to get a system that can work on a timer, so it waters and fertilizes her plants on a schedule based on what they need. It also has sensors so it can accurately adjust what the plant needs.

### User Story #2: Bob
Bob is a 82-year-old gardening enthusiast who was recently diagnosed with arthritis. He wants to be able to take care of his plants without having to strain his body. Picking up the watering can hurts his hands so he decides to find an automatic watering system for his plants and with the help of his grandkids finds one that is cost-effective and reliable so he can still keep his hobby with less strain.

Bob is a part of the local senior center gardening club. He goes often to check on the garden. However, new guidelines and a loss of staff from budget cuts mean that no one can go into the garden from Monday to Thursday. In order to save the plants from not being watered for four days, he finds and purchases an automatic watering system. Now he can set the system to automatically water the plants on days they can’t go and check on them as well as monitor the plants for anything they might need when they get back.
