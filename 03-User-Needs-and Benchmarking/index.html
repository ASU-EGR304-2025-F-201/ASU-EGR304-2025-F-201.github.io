  <h1>User Needs and Benchmarking</h1>

<h2 id="voice-of-the-customer-benchmarking">Voice of the Customer Benchmarking</h2>
<p>To learn what kind of home improvement device we should make, we brainstormed several ideas and decided on making a smart plant sensor that can help the user take care of plants using sensors and alerts. In order to get a better understanding of this product, and more specifically, the needs of our users when using a product like this, we benchmarked five similar products with the goal of generating 100 user needs, which we proceeded to categorize and rank on importance.</p>

<tr>
<td>“This is very easy to use. Have app installed and insert the device in soil. Perfect to record soil temperature. However it won't give any other information in case of any issues with the plant. Worth the price. Am keep changing every week for all my problematic plants. Wish to buy another one.”</td>
<td>1. App will alert any detectable issues with the plant (Explicit)<br>2. Device can be moved and reprogrammed easily (Latent)<br>3. Price should be worth value of device (Explicit)</td>

<tr>
<td>“I bought three of these about a year ago, and forgot to change the batteries in them. They seem to get about 3 months of battery life, if you aren't syncing then constantly? They work great, though. Only issue with device is that I wish the Bluetooth range was longer. The app, though, could use some work… You can't create your own plant, though, you have to select from the options and accept the light and water requirements it gives. And it goes by scientific name, but it does let you rename them now… I just set up my newest one… still super quick and easy to pair. It's difficult opening the back, but I'm okay with that considering I leave some of them outside in the PNW rains. It also doesn't alert you when things are dry, you have to check on it manually... ”</td>
<td>1. Device can have long range connections (Explicit)<br>2. Device will give several types of alerts that could be relevant (Latent)<br>3. User can add custom plants with custom requirements to sensor (Explicit)<br>4. User can rename plants in app (Explicit)<br>5. Device electronics are protected from weather and outdoor elements (Latent)</td>

<tr>
<td>“The instructions are kind of garbage and direct you to scan a QR code to download the app… my phone threw up an immediate red flag. I recommend only installing apps that are in the app store… it works with both the "Mi Home" app and "Flowercare". Mi Flora is difficult. I was never able to find the sensor to add, so I gave up...another worthless account created out there in the ether. Flowercare was much easier to use, and I was able to add the sensor pretty easily… About 5 mins later it stopped sending data. Again, ready to send it back. However, I also had the phone app open (which is nice BTW). It can only send to one device at a time. When I closed the phone app, it started sending to HA again. All in all, I'm pleased with it.”</td>
<td>1. Only 1 app for the device that is high quality and user-friendly (Explicit)<br>2. Device connections are stable and stay connected (Latent)<br>3. Instructions for device and app should be well made (Explicit)<br>4. App can connect to several devices at the same time (Latent)</td>

<td>“Mine died quickly. I've removed the app. Would not recommend… I'm using them outdoors, dry summer, in 1 foot deep standing boxes. I found them hard to set up and hard to connect requiring many attempts to reconnect before success whether inside or our next to the device, even when holding the device in hand. Moisture levels regularly show low % moisture when soil is moist to touch or much higher when tested with other meters (I have several direct reading meters that give results comparable to each other, but different from this meter). I bought three meters of this brand. They give different results when placed side- by- side. Soil fertility remains low even after applying water souluable fertilizer. I don't trust these. The app is of limited value. You must associate each meter with a specific target plant. The app does not include the plant varieties I plant and I can't seem to add any plants to the database. It is difficult to exit the app without signing out. The permissions required to use the app are excessive for a poor quality app. I do appreciate that the app shows a history of records, though I'm not currently confident in the ?daily average? results. I would prefer a more open app, friendlier permissions with easy opt out provisions, a longer probe to at least 8" depth, more consistent results, better connection success. I do not recommend this version… I'll be looking for improved versions.”</td>

<td>“We have a midsized back yard garden. I started to use a drip irrigation system last year because hand watering was starting to take a long of time, dragging the hose from bed to bed. These little devices connect to an EcoWitt receiver. I'm using their GW1100 model. Once you have that receiver set up... and it's pretty easy... these moisture sensors find the receiver automatically as soon as you put in the battery. You push them in the ground near the base of the plant you want to monitor and it reports the moisture percentage of the soil back to the receiver about every minute. if you connect your receiver to the EcoWitt weather server, it will log all your data and you can see both the current readings and graph the history of each sensor. So far we have just 4 sensors throughout the garden to sort of give us an overview of each crop. How much is enough is still a question that is yet to be answered. An online search of the proper soil moisture percentage results in a variety of answers, but then don't most online searches. I'm still digging for some more useful answers to that question, because so far the internet says between 20% to 80%. That's quite a range! We trying to stay at around 50% and water when it drops to around 25% and are also keeping an eye on the various plants. I should also confess I like gadgets, so I suppose you could just keep an eye on your plants.”</td>

<td>“I have five of these operating around my home. I live in an area with extremely poor soil conditions that subject my slab-on-grade home to extreme foundation movement if I don’t keep soil moisture consistent season to season. During long, hot summers my soil dries out and causes my foundation to shift dramatically. I bought a couple of these sensors in late summer 2019 to gauge long-term trends to determine ideal soil moisture conditions. After a year of gathering data, I found a good range for soil moisture to minimize foundation movement. I purchased three more (and a WN51) to stake along the perimeter of my home to monitor my soil moisture in real time. By getting this data I’m able to determine when I need to run the soaker hose and irrigation system around my home. While my foundation still moves, I’ve noticed a dramatic difference associated with keeping soil moisture levels within 5-7% of their target. I realize this might not be the targeted use of these devices, but I believe their reliability in my application serves a ringing endorsement for others looking to monitor the moisture levels in their planters in real time. The user interface is average. The app, without a full PWS, seems less than functional. I almost prefer the web-version to the app because it only shows me the active data. This, ultimately isn’t too important to me. If I could export daily data as a .csv, I’d like that ability but it’s not a deal breaker as my primary use is observation of long-term trends. For those with privacy concerns, it’s easily addressed by connected the hub to the internet via a secured guest network. If you’re not already running all of your smart devices on their own secured network away from personal devices, I suggest you do so. I’ve got a couple notes for prospective buyers: 1) I think I prefer this model (WH51) over a similar moisture meter (WN51) made by Ecowitt. These seem more granular in their ability to notice subtle differences in moisture and react much faster to changes in moisture levels. 2) Use a good lithium ion battery. At least two of my sensors have functioned for almost a year without needing to change a battery. They’ve operated in temps from 20-110F. 3) Spend 5 minutes calibrating your devices to the type of soil where the meter will be placed. Mine are primarily in Texas black clay and they require some calibrating tweaking from default. Also, in relation to the first point, the WH51 seems to have a much larger range from 0-100% saturation than the WN51. No clue why, but I like the more precise ability to measure incremental changes in moisture. I’ll update my review over time with any additional notes or issues that may arise.”</td>

<td>“I have about ten fruit trees and 10 blackberry plants, I had them for 3 years and they have come to the large you really need tp manage the water levels to get the most and best fruit. I jumped in head down this year with all the correct fertilizers and oils the plants need but, when it came to the water or moist of the soil it looks dry on the first inch or so but then where the roots are it's wet and you over water. I looked for months on the best products to just have the water level happen automatically each day as needed. I already collect 3300 gallons of rain water from my house so the water has all the natural chemicals needed, I have a pressure pump system to supply my mini sprayers but now how wet is the soil.??? I read up all the descriptions of how to setup and use this system and found next to nothing others then call them if you buy the units and need help. I did not want to waster my time with someone that may not work but, I took a chance and I I glad I did. THEY COULDN'T be easier to pair and install. You simply hook the receiver to your wifi in settings then downland their app next, put a battery in the soil unit wait 30 second and the sending units are seen by the app automatically I WISH other system were this easy you can't make a mistake. Buy these product the are outstanding in every way, attached are some screen shots you can check the soil from location you happen to be at and for me it just press that zone button and my plants are done, I only have to manually press the water button for that zone if the soil is behind dry even after the automatic cycles. GREAT product and , oh by the I own a world wide computer computer and know a GREAT product on the technology side and this rates the highest on ease of setup and results.”</td>

I ordered a fifth sensor and put it in a pot with the other one and set everything up on custom, and they're not reading the same at all. It only seems like the shelf life for these is 3 weeks. They worked great in the beginning and helped the plants be a lot healthier but seems like an absolute waste of time now. As you can see in the picture probe 4 and 5 are in the same exact pot and reading completely different Probe number 4 is about a month old and pro 5 is brand new.

<td>"This is a pretty neat system. Working great so far. Installation was easy as well. Today is only day 2 of use, so I know that I will have to adjust my timing as I learn how much time it needs to run and how often so I do not over water my plants. I bought 2 automatic watering systems. I setup 13 plants on one (6 on one line(A)/7 on the other line(B)) and 12 on the other, dividing that to 6/6 plants. So far so good and would definitely recommend."</td>

When we returned the seedling were perfectly watered and looked great. After trying so many cheap, quirky ways to keep plants moist while away, I was so happy to find this system. It’s worth every cent. It was easy to set up but I did have 30 pots so it took some time. I tested it several times and there was no leakage."</td>

<td>"I have a lot of plants. It brings the beauty of outdoors inside and purifies the air. But what do you do when you go on vacation or if you are so busy you forget to take care of your plants. This automatic watering system could be your answer. It comes with plenty of tubing, "T" connectors and watering tubes for up to 20 plants. The setup is explained well in the instructions that come with the kit and videos in the listing so I won't go into detail here. Just be sure you measure out the right lengths of hose before you cut and have a bucket of water that can hold the total amount of water you will need for the duration of the time you will be unable to water the plants yourself. To use this for multiple plants you have to do a little math. The longest you can run each of the pumps each time is 15 minutes. The total amount of water each pump can deliver in that time is 1.5 gallons (24 cups). Per minute, the pump delivers 1.6 cups. If you need more water than that, you can set the pump to run multiple times. You must divide the amount of water by the number of plants you are watering. For example, if you have 4 plants on one pump, the water delivered will be divided by 4. So if the pump is run for the full duration, each plant will get the same amount of water (6 cups). If your plants need less water, you set the run time accordingly. if you cannot divide your plants into 2 groups (1 for each pump) that need the same amount of water you will either need more of these systems or have to look at other options. Bottom line, this is a great watering solution to ensure that your plants survive a vacation or absent mindedness. Calculate your watering needs before purchase to see if this is a good solution for you."</td>

<td>"I've been looking for a watering system like the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device for awhile and was pleasantly surprised at the space economy this offers. Everything you need to get up and running is provided, including well laid out instructions with pictures. Really the only thing you need to add yourself is a water bucket of which my first use for testing purposes was a 1 gallon plastic milk jug. I will at some point be setting this up in a permanent location utilizing a larger 3 gallon, clear water jug. The timer function of the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device is very easy to set up and in my opinion, takes a little experimentation to get just right for various environments where this device will be used. Since each plant has its own unique watering needs for overall plant health and growth, I think a person can easily expand on the device water tubes a little by adding drip emitters for any given particular plant that need less or more water than others in the system. I also like that the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device utilizes both USB and AA battery power which is great feature just in case the power goes out for an extended period of time. Each of the parts included with this device seem to be very quality pieces as well as the timer/pump housing and the water tube connections pieces as well. The functionality of this product just through my initial testing has been outstanding. Overall, if you always want to keep your plants watered and healthy, the RUNWUSHENG Plant Watering Device is a real good start at a very reasonable price point. Once I have designed a reasonable location, I will be permanently setting it up for the indoor growth of herbs and flowers. I would highly recommend this product."</td>
